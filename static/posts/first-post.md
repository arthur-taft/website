Hello and welcome to my first blog post! This should be just a quick introduction into where I'm planning on going from here.

For starters, I want to actually start making blog posts. That's the important thing. I want to have a lot of documentation of what I do, and I think this is a fun way of doing it. I'm also hoping that I'll run into some esoteric issue and figure out how to solve it, that way the next person that has the same issue down the line can find an article here, and put that to good use haha.

To get started, my next blog post should be about getting the website up and running, as well as all of the effort that's gone in to making it to this point.
